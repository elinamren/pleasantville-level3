          Alex, I just woke up from this weird dream. I have a strong feeling I
          have to find this old lady though. Have you met her? Do you know her
          Alex? <br />
          I found a map of Pleasantville in my hotel room, that makes me think
          of our travels Alex, and how shitty you were on reading those. How
          many times did we get lost? I have never been in a town like this
          before. It's something strange, everyone is nice but it’s something, I
          just can't quite put my finger on it. <br />
          I can’t wait to find you. I will find you Alex!
